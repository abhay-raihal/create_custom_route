     | The result parameter in the Hdfc Payment Gateway payment response enables the merchant
     | to determine the payment status. The Merchant is advised to first check for any errors
     | received in the response message and if not check for the result parameter. On the baasis
     | of the result parameter, the merchant’s system determines whether payment is
     | Approved or Declined.
     | Mentioned below are the Response Result parameter values that could be
     | received from the Payment Gateway in the result parameter to the merchant in the
     | payment response message.
     | • CAPTURED - Payment was successful (For Action Code “1”, “2” , “5”)
     | • APPROVED - Payment was successful (For Action Code “4”)
     | • NOT CAPTURED - Payment was failed (For Action Code “1”, “2” , “5”)
     | • NOT APPROVED - Payment was failed (For Action Code “4”)
     | • DENIED BY RISK - Risk denied the payment processing
     | • HOST TIMEOUT - The authorization system did not respond within the Time out
     |   limit
     | • SUCCESS – The payment is successful (For Action Code “8” if original requested
     |   payment is successful at Payment Gateway)
     | • FAILURE(NOT CAPTURED) – The payment is failed (For Action Code “8”, if
     |   the original payment is failed at Payment Gateway)
     | • FAILURE(SUSPECT) – The payment data is not matching, and hence failed. (For
     |   action code “8, if the input requested in request is not matching with data available in
     |   Payment Gateway, then this result is thrown by Payment Gateway for inquiry
     |   payment)
