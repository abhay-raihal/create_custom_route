    <p>Hi,</p>
    <p>
        We have deactivated your  API keys, since we noticed that you are hardcoding them on your App. To continue accepting payments, we request you to generate new API keys.
    </p>
    <p>
    <p>
        To generate API key in live mode:
    </p>

    <p> 1. Log into Dashboard and switch to Live mode on the menu.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Navigate to Settings - API Keys - Re-Generate Key to generate a new API key for live mode.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Download the keys and save it securely.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. Ensure that Razorpay API secret is not included in the final Android or iOS build
    </p>


    </p>
