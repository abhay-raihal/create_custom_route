    Hi Team,
    <br/><br/>
    Hope you are doing well.
    <br/><br/>
    Please note that owing to a suspicious/abnormal pattern of international transactions observed on your Razorpay account, we had to temporarily pause international payments acceptance on your account. This is in line with the guidelines of our banking partners.
    <br/><br/>
    To resume accepting international payments, please share the supporting documents/relevant information on the recent international payments received by your business for us to review. Additionally, we would also need to review the remedial plans and preventive measures that you have put in place to control fraud and chargebacks.
    <br/><br/>
    Please feel free to reach out to us in case you have any queries regarding the documents to be submitted. The hold will remain until the investigations get completed.
    <br/><br/>
    Meanwhile, feel free to use your PayPal wallet to accept International payments.
    <br/><br/>
    You can enable PayPal in three easy steps :
    <br/>
    1. Login to your Razorpay dashboard
    <br/>
    2. Go to Settings (on the left side panel)
    <br/>
    3. Find the PayPal section under Configuration, click on Link Account, and complete your activation with PayPal. It will be enabled for your account within 48 hours.
    <br/>
    4. If you already have an existing PayPal account, you can simply link it to your Razorpay account and get started.
    <br/><br/>
    Click <a href='https://bit.ly/2QpbMVq'>here</a> to enable PayPal now.
    <br/><br/>
    Thanks & Regards,
    <br/>
    Team Razorpay
