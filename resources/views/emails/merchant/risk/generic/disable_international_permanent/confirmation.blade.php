    Dear Team,
    <br/><br/>
    Hope you are doing well and keeping safe.
    <br/><br/>
    We had to pause international payments acceptance on your Razorpay account because of a risk alert raised by our banking partners.  We also found a few inconsistencies in your account.
    <br/><br/>
    To help us resolve the same, we request you to provide any of the following  documents confirming recent successful international transactions on Razorpay:
    <br/>
    1. Detailed invoices
    <br/>
    2. Proof of delivery
    <br/>
    3. Any other proof confirming the above
    <br/><br/>
    We assure you that we are working towards resolving the issue as soon as possible and also request your cooperation in the same.
    <br/><br/>
    Meanwhile, feel free to use your PayPal wallet to accept International payments.
    <br/><br/>
    You can enable PayPal in three easy steps :
    <br/>
    1. Login to your Razorpay dashboard
    <br/>
    2. Go to Settings (on the left side panel)
    <br/>
    3. Find the PayPal section under Configuration, click on Link Account, and complete your activation with PayPal. It will be enabled for your account within 48 hours.
    <br/>
    4. If you already have an existing PayPal account, you can simply link it to your Razorpay account and get started.
    <br/><br/>
    Click <a href='https://bit.ly/2QpbMVq'>here</a> to enable PayPal now.
    <br/><br/>
    Thanks & Regards,
    <br/>
    Team Razorpay
