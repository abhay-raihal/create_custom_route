Dear Seller,

As per your confirmation on the Razorpay dashboard, we have enabled all Non-3D Secure transactions for international card payments on your Razorpay Merchant ID. 
With this development, all Non-3D Secure and 3D Secure transactions will be processed on your checkout. 
A vast majority of payments in foreign geographies take place through Non-3D Secure enrolled cards. 
You will now be able to accept payments from these cards and augment conversions. 

Non-3D Secure card transactions do not require a 2 factor authentication. 
Razorpayâ€™s Best in Class multilayered risk engine will prevent a vast majority of fraud related risks. 
However, in the remote possibility of a fraud related chargeback, the chargeback liability will lie with you. To know more about how businesses manage risks you can read our blog <a href="https://razorpay.com/learn/chargeback-mitigation/" style="color:#3495ff">here</a>.

How do I disable Non-3D Secure again?
To Disable Non 3D Secure transactions again, simply  Go to your Razorpay dashboard (payment method section) and disable Non 3D Secure transactions. Razorpay will process this request and will send an intimation once Non 3D Secure Cards are enabled for you.

           
If you have any queries, please reach out to us <a href="https://dashboard.razorpay.com/#/app/dashboard#request">here</a>

Regards,
Team Razorpay
