Hi {{{$merchantName}}}, settlements of customer payments to your bank account have been paused as we are yet to receive certain clarifications to our queries from your end. Please respond to our queries via your https://dashboard.razorpay.com/ to re-enable settlements. Meanwhile, you can still keep accepting payments from your customers, which will be settled once the review process is complete.
