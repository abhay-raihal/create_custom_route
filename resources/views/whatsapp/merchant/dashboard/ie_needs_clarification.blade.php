Hi {{$merchant_name}},
We need a few more details for your international cards payment request verification.
Note: You’ll be able to collect international card payments only after verification is complete.
To submit or check details, go to the ‘International payments’ option in ‘Account and Settings’ section on your Razorpay dashboard: https://dashboard.razorpay.com/app/payment-methods?instrument=international
Thank you,
Team Razorpay
