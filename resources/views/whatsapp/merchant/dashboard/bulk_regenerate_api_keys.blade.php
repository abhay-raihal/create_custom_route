Hi,
We have deactivated your  API keys, since we noticed that you are hardcoding them on your App. To continue accepting payments, we request you to generate new API keys.
To generate API key in live mode: 
1. Log into Dashboard and switch to Live mode on the menu. 
2. Navigate to Settings - API Keys - Re-Generate Key to generate a new API key for live mode. 
3. Download the keys and save it securely. 
4. Ensure that Razorpay API secret is not included in the final Android or iOS build
Thanks,
Team Razorpay
