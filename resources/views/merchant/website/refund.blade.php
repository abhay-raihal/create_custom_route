        {{{$data['merchant_legal_entity_name']}}} believes in helping its customers
        as far as possible, and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under
        this policy:
    </p>
    <ul class='unorder-list'>
        <li class='list-item'>
            <p class='content-text list-text'>
                Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made immediately
                after placing the order. However, the cancellation request may not be
                entertained if the orders have been communicated to the vendors/merchants
                and they have initiated the process of shipping them.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li class='list-item'>
            <p class='content-text list-text'>
                {{{$data['merchant_legal_entity_name']}}} does not accept cancellation
                requests for perishable items like flowers, eatables etc. However,
                refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the
                quality of product delivered is not good.
            </p>

                In case of receipt of damaged or defective items please report the same
                to our Customer Service team. The request will, however, be entertained
                once the merchant has checked and determined the same at his own end.
                This should be reported within
                {{{$data['website_detail']['refund_request_period']}}} of receipt of the
